# TSDCU-Net
The paper is under review.

# Code files
**TSDCU-Net** is defined as **TSDCU_net** in TSDCU_Net.py.  
The multi-textural scale features fusion block, dilated convolution block, hybrid dilated convolution block,and channel and spatial attention is also defined in TSDCU_Net.py. 
Code of baseline models is in DAUnet.py, unet.py, attention_unet.py, Unet_plus_plus.py, segnet.py, and Deeplab_v3_plus.py
wjc_dore.py defines the training, validating, and testing logic.  
dataset.py creates a data loader in Pytorch.

# How to run
Running main.py can train and test a model.
You can just train a model or test a model by denoting some codes.

# Pre-trained models
